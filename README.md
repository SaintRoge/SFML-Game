# SFML-Game
It's a sfml based game.

You only need SFML lib (2.4.1 : http://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.4.1-linux-gcc-64-bit.tar.gz) if you don't make install.

```sh
$ make all #To build
$ make install #To install SFML librairies and build
$ make mrproper #To rebuild
$ make clean #To remove useless files 
$ make run #To make and run
$ make pro #To make, clean and run
$ make zpro #To make install, clean and run
$ make one #To build and use one time 
```
If you are not a Debian (or Ubuntu) user and you want to make install, try to install SFML 2.4.1 here : http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/start-linux.php and then make all.
